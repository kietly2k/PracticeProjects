## Overview

### The challenge

Uers should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

- How to use Tailwind CSS to create a simple coming soon page.
- Handle responsive for all screen size using Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

- Refactor and add these features in the future:
  - Add a modal popup after sending an email.
  - Refactor the way layouts are handled.
  - Make the layout scale more smoothly and responsively.
  - Try handling validation using only CSS.
  - With screen sizes below 690px, the button is not displayed. The user has to scroll down (This is a bug because itâ€™s easy for the user to think that the button does not exist).
